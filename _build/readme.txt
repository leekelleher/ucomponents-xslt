The aim of this project is to provide example XSLT templates to support the uComponents package for Umbraco.

We will provide example XSLT templates for the following components:

* Multi-node Tree Picker
* XPath CheckBoxList (as part of the above MNTP helper)
* CheckBoxTree (also by way of the MNTP)
* UrlPicker (and Multi-UrlPicker)
* Multiple Textstring
* Textstring Array
